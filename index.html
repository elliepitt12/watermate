      <h2> ABOUT US </h2> <br> </br>
      <h3> Our company Aqua Bloom will be illustrating and creating a smart automated irrigation water system called Watermate that will determine when to water the soil of farmers crops based on its current moisture and humidity levels.
        <br> </br>
        This will help specifically farmers in poorer countries such as India for them to be able to produce higher quality crops for less amount of money as our system will be affordable for these people. It will help avoid crop failure due to excess or lack of water supply going to the farmers crops.
        <br> </br>Our product will be automated so that when the soil is moist enough for the crops it will turn off automatically by itself through the moisture sensor. Data will be collected from the sensors and the hardware will be visible for our user for data analysis and future data prediction for the farmers to use.
        <br> </br>There will also be a manual setting for the pump that will allow the user themselves to turn the pump on and off through the website. For this we will be providing three different languages such as English, Spanish, and Hindi. The main goal will be to help farmers grow their crops to make them healthier and of higher quality. </h3> </div>

        <h1> DESIGN EXPLAINED </h1> <br> </br>
        <h4> We'd like to introduce you to our Smart Irrigation System, which is equipped with the newest technology and software to ensure that your plants receive efficient and effective irrigation.
          <br> </br>
          The NodeMCU (ESP 8266) microcontroller, is a strong and dependable component for managing and controlling our smart irrigation system. Alongside the DHT11 sensor that measures the soilâ€™s temperature & humidity levels paired with a soil moisture sensor to determine crops internal and external conditions. With this data we can ensure that the systems can automatically adjust to ensure that your crops receive optimal watering.
          <br> </br>To prevent overloading our ESP, the irrigation system will be connected to a central server that handles all requests. The jumper cables and breadboard which will be used to connect the hardware together.
          <br> </br>Also, we will be applying a subscription model where there will be two options for the customer to choose from, one will be the standard which will allows the user to view data and perform the data analysis will cost around $7.99 and the second one will come with the data analysis as well as remote (Manual Mode) and data Preditction which will be available for $14.99. </h4> </div>
